# Health_Care_Analysis(Data Analyst Project)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a health dataset to uncover key insights related to heart disease risk factors. It leverages Power BI for data visualization and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations. The goal is to help identify trends, correlations, and risk indicators for heart disease.

  ## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### **1️⃣ General Health & Demographics**
- **Total Patients** – Total number of patients in the dataset
- **Heart Disease Cases (%)** – Percentage of patients diagnosed with heart disease
- **Average Age of Patients** – Mean age of all patients
- **Gender Distribution (%)** – Male vs. Female ratio

### **2️⃣ Cardiovascular Risk Metrics**
- **Average Cholesterol Level** – Mean cholesterol level of all patients
- **Blood Pressure Distribution** – Percentage of patients in different BP categories (Normal, Elevated, Hypertension)
- **High-Risk Patients (%)** – Percentage of individuals flagged as high-risk

### **3️⃣ Lifestyle & Behavioral Insights**
- **Smoking & Alcohol Consumption (%)** – Percentage of patients who smoke or consume alcohol
- **Average Sleep Duration** – Mean sleep hours across all patients
- **Sedentary Lifestyle (%)** – Percentage of patients with low physical activity

### **4️⃣ Family & Genetic Risk Factors**
- **Family History of Heart Disease (%)** – Percentage of patients with a family history of heart disease
- **Heart Disease Cases Among Family History Patients (%)** – How many developed heart disease

### **5️⃣ Key Trends & Risk Comparisons**
- **Heart Disease Cases by Age Group** – Percentage of cases across different age ranges
- **Cholesterol vs. Triglyceride Levels** – Relationship between these two indicators
- **Impact of Stress & Sleep on Heart Disease Risk** – How stress levels and sleep duration affect heart disease occurrence

## Process
The project began with data collection and cleaning, where patient health data was gathered, and missing or duplicate values were handled to ensure accuracy. Next, data preprocessing was performed using SQL and Excel to structure the dataset, apply transformations, and create calculated columns for meaningful analysis. Once the data was prepared, analysis and KPI calculations were conducted using DAX in Power BI, allowing for insights into cholesterol levels, blood pressure categories, and overall heart disease risk. The data was then visualized through interactive dashboards in Power BI, incorporating bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and KPI cards for an intuitive and dynamic analysis experience. Finally, the findings were interpreted to identify trends, correlations, and key risk factors, providing valuable insights to help understand heart disease risks and make informed health decisions.
